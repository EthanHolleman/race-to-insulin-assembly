# Race to insulin assembly activity


## Objective

The goal is this activity is for beginner to intermediate
Python programers (i.e. students who have familiarity with
basic programming concepts like loops, functions, etc.)
to try their hand at a computational biology themed problem.
The focus is on thinking, experimentation and problem solving
and not on the end result. 

## Activity outline

Students will work in small groups (2-3) in order to attempt
to assemble the sequence of the insulin gene from a collection
of simulated short sequence reads, similar to what would
be produced via shotgun sequencing. 

## For instructors

The easiest way to get your group going on this activity is to have each student
work on their own notebook using the Binder link provided below.

Using a Binder avoids students having to install and figure out software
dependencies on their own. It will also make debugging easier as each student
will effectively using the *exact* same computer. 

If you have not used Binders before make sure to
at least glance overview their
